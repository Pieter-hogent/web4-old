        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">many sites want to provide personalized content, and hence need a system to register and identify users</li>
          <li class="fragment">user data is considered sensitive, and many (sometimes strict) laws apply to how you handle user data (GDPR)</li>
          <li class="fragment">users (rightfully) expect you to store their data securely and with care; storing 6 letter passwords in a cleartext
            file won't cut it anymore </li>

        <h3>authentication</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">implementing all steps correctly is far from trivial, as few things involving encryption tend to be</li>
          <li class="fragment">luckily, we're also far from the first ones to attempt this, by now it's pretty well known how to tackle these
            problems
          </li>
          <li class="fragment">still, caution and diligence are advised; data breaches happen, users re-use their same passwords, exposing user
            info is always bad, even on seemingly 'unimportant' sites</li>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>authentication steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">create a database table (collection), PROPERLY store username and password</li>
          <li class="fragment">provide routes to login / register new users in your backend</li>
          <li class="fragment">choose a secure way to communicate who's logged in between front and backend (e.g. jwt)</li>
          <li class="fragment">protect all backend routes which shouldn't be accessible by everyone</li>
          <li class="fragment">properly store and send your token (or cookie) in the frontend so you do get access where you should</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h3>authentication DON'T's</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">NEVER trust the frontend, sanitize everything in your backend</li>
          <li class="fragment">DO NOT rely on 'secrets' or urls only you know to secure something</li>
          <li class="fragment">DO NOT invent your own encryption mechanism, that is really, really (really) hard</li>
          <li class="fragment">NEVER trust the frontend</li>

        <h6>Bitgrail crypto 'hack', early 2018, $170 million stolen</h6>
        <p>"There was a bug, on the withdraw page. But this check was only on java-script client side, you find the js which
          is sending the request, then you inspect element - console, and run the java-script manually, to send a request
          for withdrawal of a higher amount than in your balance. Bitgrail delivered this withdrawal. How many people did
          this? Who knows. This bug was later closed."</p>

            <p show-steps='1'>I hope you already know it's not a good idea to store passwords as plain text</p>
            <p show-steps='2'>while it might be convenient to check passwords, and retrieve lost ones, if your database is leaked, everything
              is out in the open</p>
            <p show-steps='3'>encrypting/decrypting the password is slightly better, people need to get hold of both the database AND your
              encryption key</p>
            <p show-steps='4'>still, in the end this is pretty bad, once both do get out, every single user his info is out in the open again,
              and if you can't trust your database to be safe, can you really say database+secret is much safer?</p>
            <p show-steps='5'>it's much better to store a one way hash of the password, if the user tries to login, you hash again and can
              check if he is who he claims he is</p>
            <p show-steps='6'>but if your database is leaked, you can't retrieve the password based on the hash ('one way'), retrieving lost
              passwords becomes a bit more cumbersome though (you can only assign a new one, not retrieve an existing)</p>
            <p show-steps='7'>still, while you can't retrieve a password from a hash, you can easily calculate hashes from passwords (that's
              the whole point), and many people tend to use very common passwords ('password', 'password1', 'pass123', ...)</p>
            <p show-steps='8'>so it's possible to pre-calculate all the common passwords (= rainbow table) and then simply check if you find
              users with any of those hashes; you can't find a login for a specific user this way, but you can probably find
              many logins for many users</p>
