        <h3>what changed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">there used to be no 'real' client side state, everything had to be encoded in the url / cookie since the client
            side was overwritten with every request</li>
          <li class="fragment">with a SPA the client is persistent too, we typically hold a cache of the server state, and some client specific
            state on top of that</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>5 kinds of state</h3>
        <p>state is stored, and duplicated, at various places in our app</p>
        <ul>
          <li>server state</li>
          <li>persistent client state</li>
          <li>local client state</li>
          <li>url (or router) state</li>
          <li>transient client state</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>server state</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">typically some sort of database which stores info about every user and every aspect of our webapp</li>
          <li class="fragment">providing efficient and correct access to this state is a (really) hard problem in itself (sharding, CDN, ...)
            but not the topic of today</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>persistent client state</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">this is a subset of the server state on our client, often limited to the user and what she has done till now</li>
          <li class="fragment">while 'in the end' you want the server and persistent client state to be the same, at certain points in time they
            can (and will) differ
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">server can be ahead: the client still needs a 'refresh'</li>
              <li class="fragment">the client can also be ahead, optimisticly showing updates which still need to happen on the server</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>local client state</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">client state that is NOT stored on the server</li>
          <li class="fragment">things like a local filter, sort settings on a table, ...</li>
          <li class="fragment">usually (but not limited to) stuff that changes the way you view the data from the server </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>url (router) state</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">reflects both the persistent and the local client state</li>
          <li class="fragment">very important that it always reflects what the user sees, people expect bookmarking, back/forward and copying
            links to work</li>
          <li class="fragment">always keep in mind users can (and will) alter the url to navigate your app, this should always work correctly</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>transient client state</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">less important, but some things that are part of your state will not be reflected in the url or on the server</li>
          <li class="fragment">the canonical example: if you pause a youtube video, switch to another window and switch back, you can continue
            playing where you left of, but this is nowhere reflected neither on the server nor in the url</li>

            <p show-steps='5'>we could naively fix this by router navigating to our url whenever the filter changes (so effectively changing

            <p show-steps='6'>the url is not read, so navigating doesn't do anything, but at least we can see the filters in the url</p>

          <li>for real code, you shouldn't write your own store, ngrx implements all this functionality (and much more!) very
            cleanly
          </li>
          <li>it's like redux-for-angular, and it's becoming more and more popular for managing state in angular apps </li>
          <li>let's do a small
            <a href="https://coursetro.com/posts/code/151/Angular-Ngrx-Store-Tutorial---Learn-Angular-State-Management">tutorial</a> to set up a small app with ngrx</li>

      <!-- syncing persistent and server state
			<br/>url en client state syncen

			<br> switchmap lost enkel race condition op omdat er een grote stream van actions is
			<br>router as source of truth: user can always alter url and resubmit, so it has to work, so you can just as well start from
